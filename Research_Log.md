# Constellation 2.0 Research Log

### August 7th, 2018

- Decided to pivot from old idea
- New idea uses applied linear regression for edge detection, and then formulate planes via a neural network
- From the planes found in an image, you can find their distance from camera at different points on the shape and use it to form a "gradient distance" and find the orientation of the plane
- Read some papers and did some research into optimization problems, tradeoffs, and gradient descent
