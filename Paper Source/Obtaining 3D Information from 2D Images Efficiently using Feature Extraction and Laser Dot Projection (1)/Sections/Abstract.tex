In this paper, the development and application of a system to computationally inexpensively determine a three dimensional model of a space from only a single image is presented, using applied machine learning and simple hardware components. Using feature classification of the relevant objects in the original scene, in collection with a physical grid of laser dots refracted across the scene, the system is able to quickly judge the nature of the object, its position in relation to other objects around it, and distance of those objects from the camera, traits which are commonly compromised on comparable approaches. The system is \begin{it}x\end{it} times more efficient on average than current industry leading approaches, and has potential applications in various fields requiring rapidly updating spatial awareness and environment generation, including autonomous vehicles, defense, and architecture.
