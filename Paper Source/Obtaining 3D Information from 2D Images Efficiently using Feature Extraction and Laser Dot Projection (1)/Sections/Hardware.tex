While most practical industry or even hobby applications of the concepts presented in Constellation and the library itself will take place on far more powerful machines than those Constellation was developed and tested on, in its testing, Constellation still performed well compared to other approaches to the same problem. For compatibility assurance, Constellation was tested primarily on three seperate machines, each with drastically different components, and tested with two operating systems.

The first testing machine ran a copy of Apple's macintoshOS operating system. The machine had 2.3 Gigahertz Intel Core i5 processor, which allowed the processor to run at a clock rate of 2.3 billion cycles per second. Additionally, the machine had 8 Gigabytes of 2133 Megahertz LPDDR3 memory, and a 1536 megabyte Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 graphics card. The second testing machine was operating on the Microsoft Windows operating system.

As shown below, the system was still able to perform well on the Apple computer, despite comparatively inferior components, due to a concurrency modification that is still in beta, which allowed the computer to distribute the computations of certain processes across two processors, thereby decreasing the load of each individual processor.
