\subsection{Binocular Computer Stereo Vision}
In order to perceive depth the human eye uses many visual cues, both monocular and binocular. Of these visual cues, stereopsis, the perception of depth resulting from the brain comparing the differences in images produced by both eyes, is in many ways one of the easiest depth perceptions methods to mimic through software, as it is the least reliant on external sources of stimuli and human experience. This is what Stereo Computer Vision attempts to do; building depth maps by comparing scenes from multiple vantage points. More specifically Binocular Computer Stereo Vision does this by comparing the images from two cameras and by extracting and comparing common features from both images it builds a depth map of the scene in question.
